# Is this vibe coded?
  Yes, I know some people don't like vibe coded programs, but I am simply not that experienced with coding using Flet so I had to use AI.

# Why are there two downloads for linux?
  The zip version is for people who have problems with the self-extracting version. This can be caused by multiple things so I prefer to keep it just in case.
