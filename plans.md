# Future Plans & Ideas

## Audio Utilities Tab
A dedicated mode for specialized audio tasks within video files.

### 🎯 Current Goals:
- **Audio Replacement:** Easily swap the audio track of a video file with an external audio file (e.g., replacing background noise with background music).
- **Volume Normalization:** Automatically normalize audio levels so that "quiet" videos are brought up to a standard volume without clipping.

### 🚀 Future Possibilities:
- **Audio Boost:** Simple gain slider to boost audio on extremely quiet recordings.
- **Silence Removal:** Detect and automatically trim silent gaps in footage.
